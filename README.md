# UHM23.github.io

Started as a simple test of github pages & how to use git & github on 20/09/23

Currently 9am on 22/09/23 it has a Logo Page with a simple menu
* The Menu has a link to a Work In Progress tinkering in javascript called AsciiArtEels
* The Menu also has a link to my projects journal: jugglecode.wordpress.com

ToDo:
Learn about SVG scaling so I can fix the SVG height bug
