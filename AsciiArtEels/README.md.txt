The code for this is based on the code in the tutorial video:
ASCII Art with Vanilla JavaScript by Franks Laboratory.

The original version is a static effect.
I added the rudimentary animation and my own text strings instead of symbols.

This isn't great code, but I really like experimenting with graphics code.

ToDo:

Document the algorithm.
